# Totsu

Totsu (å‡¸ in Japanese) means convex.

## solver_rust_conic/

The crates for Rust of

* `totsu_core`: A first-order conic linear program solver for convex optimization.
* `totsu`: Convex optimization problems LP/QP/QCQP/SOCP/SDP that can be solved by `totsu_core`.
* `totsu_f64lapack`: BLAS/LAPACK linear algebra operations for `totsu`/`totsu_core`.
